- Background color: Light gray (#F0F2F5), very low saturation and high brightness to provide a clean and familiar backdrop, consistent with Facebook's UI.
- Accent color: A slightly darker shade of blue (#3A559F), less saturated and with lower brightness than the primary, used for highlighting interactive elements, creating a subtle contrast without straying from the core brand identity.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean, modern, and readable interface.
- Use simple, clean icons that are easily recognizable and consistent with the Facebook style.
- Maintain a clean and organized layout, similar to Facebook, with clear sections for each module.
- Subtle animations for feedback on interactions, like button presses and form submissions, avoiding any flashy or distracting effects.
